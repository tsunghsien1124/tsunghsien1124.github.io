title : Discretization of AR(1) Process Using Adda and Copper (2003)
permalink: /Computation/:title/

Discretization plays a necessary role.
There are multiple widely used approaches, including Tauchen, Rouwenhorst, and **Adda and Cooper (2003)**[^1] (hereafter, AC2003).
Package `QuantEcon` in `Julia` contains the former two; yet, I cannot find a decent implementation for the last one in `Julia`.
Hence, this blog aims to fill this void.
In the following, I will firstly explain how AC2003 works and then show how it can be coded in `Julia`.

#### How AC(2003) Works

Suppose that we have the following AR(1) process.

\\[ \begin{equation} \epsilon_t = \mu (1-\rho) + \rho \epsilon_{t-1} + u_t, \end{equation} \\]

where

#### Implementation in `Julia`

Define a function $f(x) = x^2$ as follows.

```julia, echo = false, results = "hidden"
f(x) = x^2
```

Such function evaluated at 2 is given by $f(2) = `j f(2)`$.

\\[\log(2) + 5y = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{z} \, dz\\]

#### Test Plot.jl

Load Plots.jl

```julia
using Plots
```

Plot a figure with randomly generated data.

```julia
N = 100
x = rand(N)
y = rand(N)
plot(x, y)
```
