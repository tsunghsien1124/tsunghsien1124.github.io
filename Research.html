	<b> Abstract: </b> Many credit cardholders in the U.S. turn to expensive payday loans, even though they have not yet exhausted their credit lines. This results in significant monetary costs and has been coined the &#8220;Payday Loan Puzzle.&#8221; We propose the novel explanation that households use payday loans to protect their credit scores since payday lenders do not report to credit bureaus. To quantitatively examine this hypothesis, we build a two-asset Huggett-type model with two default options as well as both hidden information and actions. Using our calibrated model, we can account for 40% of the empirically identified payday loan borrowers with liquidity left on their credit cards. We can also match the magnitude of monetary costs due to this seeming pecuniary mistake. To inform the policy debate over payday lending, we assess the welfare implications of several policy counterfactuals. We find that either banning payday loans or increasing their default costs results in a welfare loss in aggregate.

	<b> Abstract: </b> Bankruptcy leniency leads to higher default premia in equilibrium, thus rendering financial intermediaries more externally funded. However, more leveraged intermediaries face a higher refinancing cost when financial frictions arise because of moral hazards. The extra cost further pushes up the borrowing prices (refinancing channel). In addition, the extra cost reduces banks' investment in physical capital due to the no-arbitrage condition. Lower investment decreases wage earnings for all households (divestment channel). Both forces jointly influence the welfare implication of bankruptcy regimes. To understand the effects of financial frictions, I develop an Aiyagari-type heterogeneous agent model with consumer default and the agency problem between banks and depositors. In this setting, the welfare conclusion depends further on the influences of refinancing and divestment channels. As a result, a lenient bankruptcy code is not necessarily optimal even when households face significant idiosyncratic risks.

	<b> Abstract: </b> To quantitatively study the stylized facts of the Taiwanese housing market and its relationship with the real sectors over the past 20 years, I estimate a small open-economy New Keynesian DSGE model of housing markets and collateral constraints with Bayesian techniques. I find that introducing collateral constraints can improve the traditional DSGE models' ability to calibrate the Taiwanese economy. In addition, the fluctuations of new houses and housing prices result primarily from the inclination to housing service and the progress of housing technology. Finally, the results suggest that domestic monetary policy does not drive Taiwan's sheer ballooning housing prices.
