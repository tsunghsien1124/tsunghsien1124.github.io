	<b> Abstract: </b> Many credit cardholders in the U.S. turn to expensive payday loans, even though they have not yet exhausted their credit lines. This results in significant monetary costs and has been coined the "Payday Loan Puzzle". We propose the novel explanation that households use payday loans to protect their credit scores since payday lenders do not report to credit bureaus. To quantitatively examine this hypothesis, we build a two-asset Huggett-type model with two default options as well as both hidden information and actions. Using our calibrated model, we can quantitatively account for 40% of the empirically identified payday loan users with liquidity left on their credit cards. We can also match the magnitude of monetary costs due to this seeming pecuniary mistake. To inform the policy debate over payday lending, we assess the welfare implications of several policy counterfactuals such as banning payday loans or increasing the default costs. We find that banning payday loans or increasing their default costs is welfare decreasing in aggregate.

<p style="font-size: 15px; background-color:WhiteSmoke"> <b>Abstract</b>: <br> It has been documented in the literature that in the U.S. many credit cardholders turn to payday loans, even though they have not yet exhausted their credit lines. This results in significant monetary losses and has been coined the "Payday Loan Puzzle". One proposed explanation is that households use payday loans in order to protect their credit scores (reputation protection). In order to understand the puzzle and test this hypothesis, we build a Huggett-type model with consumer default and asymmetric information. To smooth consumption, households can save or borrow using either bank loans, payday loans, or both, as well as file for bankruptcy. Lenders cannot observe households' discount factors or payday loans and thus resort to credit scores as a proxy for their creditworthiness. Our model can quantitatively account for the payday loan puzzle observed in the data both extensively as well as intensively. We illustrate how the proposed reputation protection channel works in this model and leads to the emergence of the puzzle. </p>
