<p style="font-size: 15px; background-color:WhiteSmoke"> <b>Abstract</b>: <br> It has been documented in the literature that in the U.S. many credit cardholders turn to payday loans, even though they have not yet exhausted their credit lines. This results in significant monetary losses and has been coined the "Payday Loan Puzzle". One proposed explanation is that households use payday loans in order to protect their credit scores (reputation protection). In order to understand the puzzle and test this hypothesis, we build a Huggett-type model with consumer default and asymmetric information. To smooth consumption, households can save or borrow using either bank loans, payday loans, or both, as well as file for bankruptcy. Lenders cannot observe households' discount factors or payday loans and thus resort to credit scores as a proxy for their creditworthiness. Our model can quantitatively account for the payday loan puzzle observed in the data both extensively as well as intensively. We illustrate how the proposed reputation protection channel works in this model and leads to the emergence of the puzzle. </p>
