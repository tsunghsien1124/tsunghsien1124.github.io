Discretization plays a necessary role.
There are multiple widely used approaches, including Tauchen, Rouwenhorst, and **Adda and Cooper (2003)**[^1] (hereafter, AC2003).
Package `QuantEcon` in `Julia` contains the former two; yet, I cannot find a decent implementation for the last one in `Julia`.
Hence, this blog aims to fill this void.
In the following, I will firstly explain how AC2003 works and then show how it can be coded in `Julia`.

#### How AC(2003) Works

The following will stick mostly to the original treatment in their book, albeit slightly contaminated with my preference and interpretation. 
Suppose that we have the following AR(1) process.

\\[ \begin{equation} \epsilon_t = \mu (1-\rho) + \rho \epsilon_{t-1} + u_t, \end{equation} \\]

where

#### How to Program AC2003 in `Julia`

Define a function $f(x) = x^2$ as follows.




Such function evaluated at 2 is given by $f(2) = 4$.

\\[\log(2) + 5y = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{z} \, dz\\]

#### Test Plot.jl

Load Plots.jl

```julia
using Plots
```




Plot a figure with randomly generated data.

```julia
N = 100
x = rand(N)
y = rand(N)
plot(x, y)
```
