# Test Math Display

Define a function $f(x) = x^2$ as follows.

```
f (generic function with 1 method)
```





Such function evaluated at 2 is given by $f(2) = 4$.

\[\log(2) + 5y = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{z} \, dz\]

# Test Plot.jl

Load Plots.jl

```julia
using Plots
```




Plot a figure with randomly generated data.

```julia
N = 100
x = rand(N)
y = rand(N)
plot(x, y)
```
